        <section id="tribute-list">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="year">1959</span>Satoru Iwata was born on December 6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo,
                    Japan.

                <li><span class="year">1975</span>He entered the Hokkaido Sapporo South High School and began developing

                <li><span class="year">1978</span>Iwata was admitted to the Tokyo Institute of Technology and majored in
                    computer science.</li>

                <li><span class="year">1980</span>He was employed as a part-time programmer at HAL Laboratory while

                    employee.</li>

                <li><span class="year">1983</span>He became coordinator of software production at HAL and spearheaded
                    the
                    company’s efforts to develop games for Nintendo’s NES game console.</li>

                <li><span class="year">1993</span>Iwata was promoted to president of HAL. He would lift the company from
                    the brink of bankruptcy and
                    stabilize
                    its finalcials within six years with Nintendo’s support.</li>

                <li><span class="year">2000</span>Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of corporate planning. He also had a
                    seat on the board of directors.</li>

                <li><span class="year">2004</span>He became Nintendo’s fourth president and introduced a blue ocean
                    strategy that would result in the release of the Nintendo DS and later the Wii. Both devices aimed
                    to provide
                    a unique gameplay experience to a wider audience over the typical approach of increased fidelity in
                    games.
                </li>

                <li><span class="year">2005</span>Iwata revealed the Wii, Nintendo’s next game console, at E3. Later in
                    2005 at the Tokyo Game show he revealed it’s tv remote like controller.
                </li>

                <li><span class="year">2006</span>He launched Iwata Asks, a series of articles where he interviewed
                    Nintendo developers about their games.
                </li>

                <li><span class="year">2011</span>Iwata helped introduce Nintendo direct, the company’s live virtual
                    event
                    that was open to all worldwide via online streaming platforms like Youtube.
                </li>

                <li><span class="year">2012</span>Iwata revealed the Wii, Nintendo’s next game console, at E3. Later in
                    2005
                    at the Tokyo Game show he revealed it’s strange controller.
                </li>

                <li><span class="year">2014</span>In January 2014 Iwata along with other high ranking Nintendo execs
                    took drastic paycuts in respose to the Wii U’s poor sales figures. He didn’t attend the E3 2014
                    conference due to his surgery done a week prior. He did however appear in an epic pre-recorded fight
                    sequence
                    with Reggie Fils-Aimé.
                </li>

                <li><span class="year">2015</span>Iwata was hospitalized due to serious illness and died on July 11 at
                    the age of 55.
                </li>

                <li><span class="year">2017</span>Nintendo released the Nintendo Switch, a new hybrid console, worldwide
                    on March 3, 2017. It was a part of a strategy initiated by Iwata and a few other Nintendo execs to
                    reinvigorate Nintendo’s sales after the lacluster sales of the Wii U. It was an evolution of their
                    blue ocean strategy that spawned the Wii and sought to differenciate Nintendo’s console offering
                    with a
                    unique experience. The switch has been a massive success and is my favourite game console of all
                    time. Thank you Iwata.
